# CAN Bus Nominal Bit Timing Calculator
Author: Ben Evans <ben@canbusdebugger.com>

This algorithm was created for use on CAN Bus Debugger devices but is also available in JS form here. For more information on this algorithm please see https://www.canbusdebugger.com/can-bit-timing-calculator

## Future Work
This file is still a work in progress and will be tidied up over time. It requires:
* Change capability and results dictionaries to classes
* Add additional sanity checking
* Tidy up and further document this repository
